Stretch Questions

What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? An element is removed from the flow when absolutely positioned; it is ignored by other elements. 
How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 
    The box model is used by CSS to design and layout html content. Margin, borders, padding and (actual) content boxes are manipulated; all of which are centered around the content by default.
    Every HTML element has an invisible box around it to start with. The alternative box model is achieved by using the following element selectors 
    html {
        box-sizing: border-box;
        }
    *, *::before, *::after {
        box-sizing: inherit;
        }
